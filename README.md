# Lunar-Landing-Simulation
#I made this for a history class final, and I thought I could share it here with you guys!
#Listen up Astronauts! 
#This simulation was designed to help prepare you for a lunar landing
#To use this simulation you will be dealing with multiple variables
#Orientation- this is anywhere from 0-360 degrees, 90deg is completly vertical etc etc
#Distance - this is how close you are to the ground
#Speed - how fast you're going, use more rocket power to slow down
#Fuel - how much gas you got left in the tank, correction and rocket power drains this 
#rocket power -  you lose 1.25(n percent you decide to use) of fuel
#rocket power contd - but you'll lose (0.88 n percent) from your speed
#correction - you lose 0.15(n degrees you decide to correct) of fuel 
# You will be given randomly generated variables to use at first, then you use your new values
# until you land
#Each 'turn' is equal to one second
#To land successfully you must be have your distance be equal to or less than zero
#Have your speed less than 20 and your orientation between 80 and 97 degrees
